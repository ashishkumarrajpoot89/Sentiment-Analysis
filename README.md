# 💬 Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This project is built using Python and focuses on analyzing textual data to extract emotional tone, commonly used for product reviews, social media analysis, or customer feedback.

## 📌 Features

- Preprocesses raw text (removes stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
- Converts text to numerical format using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
- Trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Predicts sentiment of custom input text
- Optional: Deployable as a Streamlit or Flask web app

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Source: [Your dataset source here – e.g., Kaggle, Twitter API]
- Format: CSV with columns like `Text`, `Sentiment`

Example:

| Text                             | Sentiment |
|----------------------------------|-----------|
